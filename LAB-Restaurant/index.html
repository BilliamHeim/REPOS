      <p>Is your mouth tiny and small? Then come on down to Lil' Bits! Before I
        opened this restaurant, whenever I ate out it was hard to finish a plate
        before the food was cold.  Here at Lil' Bits we've not only got what you
        crave, we have it in overly manageable portions! Never again feel
        embarrassed trying to fit "average-sized" food down your gullet, and say
        goodbye to choosing between a mouthful of either bread or meat when you
        order a burger. And if it's not utility you're after, you and your
        followers on social will love seeing your meals' adorable portions on
        such incredibly average plates.
