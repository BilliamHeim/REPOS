        <h3>How to play:</h3>
        <p>The game is simple, you start with a set amount of money. 
            Place your bet and then click roll! If you roll a seven you win, otherwise you lose what you bet.
            The game will keep track of your max winnings, and how many rolls you've made. That's it!
